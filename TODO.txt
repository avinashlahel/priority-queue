Create a modern and visually appealing landing page for a Software Development & Consulting firm using HTML5 and CSS3. The page should showcase our expertise in developing advanced AI applications (automation, chatbots), modern software, and mobile solutions. Use a soothing color scheme (such as pale blues, soft greens, and gentle grays) and include tasteful, high-quality images and icons illustrating AI/automation, chatbots, and mobile development. Ensure the design is clean, user-friendly, and exemplifies innovation.


Structure the landing page with the following sections:
Header: Company logo, navigation menu (Home, Services, About, Contact)
Hero Section: Large, welcoming headline. Subheadline emphasizing AI, automation, and software/mobile development expertise. Attractive call-to-action button ("Get a Free Consultation" or "Contact Us").
Features: Three main cards or sections for (a) AI Automation, (b) Chatbots, (c) Software/Mobile Apps. Each should include a modern icon/image and a brief description.
About Us: A short paragraph about the company and its mission.
Portfolio/Showcase: Carousel or grid showing recent AI projects, chatbots, or mobile apps.
Testimonials: Quotes from satisfied clients.
Footer: Social links, contact info, copyright.


Use a soothing, modern color palette: primary—pale blue (#e3f2fd), accents in soft green (#b2dfdb), and complementary gentle gray (#f5f5f5). Text primarily in deep charcoal (#263238).
Use Google Fonts such as 'Montserrat' or 'Roboto' for a clean, modern feel.
All images/icons should relate to AI development, automation, chatbots, mobile devices, and innovation. Use SVGs or royalty-free image placeholders.
Add subtle hover effects to buttons and cards for modern interactivity.

Add modern web features:
Responsive layout (works beautifully on desktop and mobile)
Smooth scrolling navigation
Sticky header
Cards or sections with slight shadows/elevations for depth
Button/link hover transitions
Optional: Animated hero image or subtle background animation (e.g., floating dots depicting AI network).

Write clean, semantically structured HTML5 code.
Use CSS3 for all styling.
Ensure accessibility (proper use of landmarks and alt text on all images).
Use CSS variables for easy theming.
The code should be well-commented so future developers can maintain or extend it.
